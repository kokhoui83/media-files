00:00:08.451 --> 00:00:10.092
Jyn, whatever I do,

2
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.120
I do it to protect you.

3
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.091
You understand?

4
00:00:16.446 --> 00:00:17.474
I understand.

5
00:00:37.531 --> 00:00:38.921
You want to get out of here?

6
00:00:39.954 --> 00:00:43.917
Our rebellion, is all that remains
to push back the Empire.

7
00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:47.142
I think you might be able
to help us.

8
00:00:47.393 --> 00:00:49.701
When was the last time
you were in contact with your father?

9
00:00:49.951 --> 00:00:51.426
What is this?!

10
00:00:53.677 --> 00:00:57.265
It appears he's critical
to the development of a super weapon.

11
00:01:00.148 --> 00:01:01.560
If my father built this thing,

12
00:01:02.206 --> 00:01:03.355
we need to find him.

13
00:01:03.604 --> 00:01:05.522
All right, how many do I need?

14
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.402
They are requesting a call sign.

15
00:01:11.584 --> 00:01:13.322
Rogue, Rogue One!

16
00:01:16.575 --> 00:01:17.576
The power

17
00:01:17.826 --> 00:01:21.456
that we are dealing with here
is immeasurable.

18
00:01:22.361 --> 00:01:25.959
If this Empire has this kind of power,
what chance do we have?

19
00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:32.759
We have hope.

20
00:01:33.703 --> 00:01:35.052
Rebellions are built on hope.

21
00:01:41.433 --> 00:01:43.102
They have no idea we're coming.

22
00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:48.316
Take hold of this moment!
The Force is strong.

23
00:01:49.108 --> 00:01:51.486
Make ten men feel like a hundred.

24
00:01:54.322 --> 00:01:55.865
We'll take the next chance,

25
00:01:57.742 --> 00:01:58.951
and the next.

26
00:02:01.441 --> 00:02:02.831
You're all rebels, aren't you?

27
00:02:05.331 --> 00:02:06.500
Save the rebellion!

28
00:02:07.626 --> 00:02:08.669
Save the dream!

29
00:02:14.187 --> 00:02:21.951
